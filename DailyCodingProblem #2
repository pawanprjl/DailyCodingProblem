This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

def newArray(X):
	array = []
	for i in range(len(X)):
		product = 1
		for j in range(len(X)):
			if(i == j):
				continue
			product *= X[j]
		array.append(product)
	return array

X = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(newArray(X))
