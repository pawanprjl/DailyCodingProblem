This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

'''
import time

def func():
  print("hello world !!!")
  
def scheduler(f, n):
  delay = n / 1000
  time.sleep(delay)
  f()
  
if __name__ = '__main__':
  scheduler(func, 5000)
