This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

'''

def isSum(k, X):
	sum = 0
	for i in range(len(X)):
		for j in range(i, len(X)):
			sum = X[i] + X[j]
			if(sum == k):
				return True
	return False

X = [10, 15, 3, 7]
print(isSum(17, X))
